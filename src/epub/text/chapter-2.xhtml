					<span>The village wherein yawned Eugene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was a delightful little spot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There friends of pure delight had been</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grateful to Heaven for their lot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lonely mansion-house to screen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From gales a hill behind was seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before it ran a stream. Behold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Afar, where clothed in green and gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meadows and cornfields are displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Villages in the distance show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And herds of oxen wandering low;</span>

					<span>Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thick immense neglected grove</span>

					<span>Extended⁠—haunt which Dryads love.</span>
